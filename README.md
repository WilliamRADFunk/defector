# defector
A 3D (Three.js) first-person adventure game that explores custom-made collision detection.</br></br>
This game will have two major focus points: AI of the enemy, and level creation.</br></br>
Any relevant objects will be added to JavaScript array variables. Looping through these will determine if player's world coordinates come within a predefined distance of the object's world coordinates.</br></br>
AI of enemy bots will enlist the basics of AI methods: search(), chase(), evade(), etc.</br></br>
This game is designed not to need physics while using camera controls and coordinate manipulation to simulate the existence of physics, but without the computational overhead.</br></br>
